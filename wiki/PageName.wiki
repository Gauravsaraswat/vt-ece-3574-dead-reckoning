  # The user will see a  GUI available with buttons, "CHOOSE MAP" and "LIVE/RAW DATA" (Kim)
  # The user will have access to accelerometer data after hitting the 2nd button (Nathan)
  # The user will have access to filtered accelerometer data on the same page (Mike)
  # The user will see an overlay of collision boundaries on top of the map (Roger)

=== Build Notes ===
 I, Nathan, want to build a service using SensorManager that records data into (a) Content Provider array(s) to be accessed by the Filter (Mike). The Filter outputs usable information (e.g. velocity) into a different Content Provider. This information is used by MapClass (Kim) to move a dot on a screen. MapClass provides info in a third Content Provider containing dot location, map size, and absolute and relative wall locations. The information in the Filter and MapClass Content Providers will be used by CollisionManager (Roger) to avoid errors and correct/predict position. \

Of course, this dot won't move in this first cycle.
