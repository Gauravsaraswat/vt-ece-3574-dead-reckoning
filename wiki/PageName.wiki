Like a boss.

= Build Cycle 1/31 - 2/9 =

  # The user will see a  GUI available with buttons, "CHOOSE MAP" and "LIVE/RAW DATA" (Kim)
  # The user will have access to accelerometer data after hitting the 2nd button (Nathan)
  # The user will have access to filtered accelerometer data on the same page (Mike)
  # The user will see an overlay of collision boundaries on top of the map (Roger)

= Build Cycle 2/14 - 2/23 =


  # The user will have a non-image in the 'Map' screen built with OpenGL drawing on a Map class. (Roger && Kim)
  # The user will have a rough estimation of speed, if not actual speed (possibly a 1-10 scale), displayed on the map screen to indicate the cross functionality of the accelerometer and the skeleton Map interface. (Nathan, Mike)

= Build Cycle 2/28 - 3/15 =
The ides of March hath come.

  #The user will have access to a map of the classroom (Kim)
  #The user's movement will be represented with a moving dot (Nathan, Roger) 
  #The user will be able to orient the phone in any way and not have it be considered movement. (Mike)
Note: The crux of our project relies on the algorithms that are applied to the hardware and data structures. This cycle will involve understanding the math and beginning to build a map with OpenGL.
